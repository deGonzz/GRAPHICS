Assignment 2: Lorenz Attractor
Professor: Schreuder
CSCI4229/5229 Fall 2015

Time to complete the assignment: ~3 hours

Note about hw2: It seems like the graph represents two connected orbits.

The key bindings are:
  q/w    Increase/decrease s parameter of Lorenz curve
  o/p    Increase/decrease b parameter of Lorenz curve
  z/m    Increase/decrease r parameter of Lorenz curve
  +/-    Increase/decrease w
  arrows Change view angle
  0      Reset view angle
  ESC    Exit

1) First "make"
2) Then just, run “hw2”
