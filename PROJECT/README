Final Project: Night rides in the city
CSCI4229/5229

To run the program:
    In your terminal, type: "make; ./myproject"

NOTES: 
    - Building the city was time consumming. I made an effort to not replicate the same building twice so I had to model several types.
    - Building a simple car was a challenge especially the tires. 
    - Figuring how to make the car move took a long time. Once that was figured out, I had to find a way to make them ride around in different paths and different time loops. That took quite a while. I wanted to do more cars but was afraid that they might end up crashing into each other.
    - Trying to figuring out spot lights for lightpoles took the longest time, and I could not quite make it work. Therefore, the shadows on the car are not very accurate. I figured out a way to light up the street using positional light sources.


Key bindings are:
  m          Modes (orthogonal, perspective, first person navigation)
  n          Interrupt light movement
  l          Toggle lighting
  +/-        Changes field of view for perspective
  </>        Move light when stopped
  x          Toggle axes on and off
  ESC        Exit
  0          Reset view angle

  In orthogonal and perspective modes:
  	arrows     Change view angle 
    
  In first person navigation
  	arrows     Change view angle on static plane
  	w/s        Change height
